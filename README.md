#Hack20 Flutter Online International Hackathon 2020


"Heal the world, and make it a better place"


2020 is a tough year to human due to COVID-19, but it create positive impact to natural habitat as lockdown that reduce human activity. Many country reported that the air turn fresh, water turn clear, even animals are free! There are damages we missed seeing, increase of wastes generated by ecommerce, food delivery. The waste creation like flyer bag, food container, carton box increasing tremendously and most people didn't dispose them correctly. As a buyer and seller, I reuse it instead throw it away.
Greenery is a community-driven platform to reduce the negative impact to natural by extend the waste lifetime. People can trade or barter the reusable waste like flyer bag, carton box, bubble wrap, for cash, even free hug. With social knowledge, people who are curious, interested or trying to reduce the amount of waste can share their solution and vote the best. And thus create the social credit system of "Green".
